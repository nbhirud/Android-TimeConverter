# TimeConverter
An Android application where you could enter time in UTC and convert it to Time-Zones in the United States

See directory TimeConverter/Readme for details:

Note: This may not be a completed application, and is intended to be "as is" when created within the 3 hour window we used to have during our Mobile Application Development (MAD) using Android lectures. The application may or may not be complete, and may also have additional functionality if I felt like working on them later.
